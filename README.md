# basilikum

A Small Collection of minimal react components utilizing styled-components &
intended to be extendable.

With the project still being in the very early stages it will certainly be found
lacking, as is to be expected, any problems will be happily received on the
issue boards

There is also a very basic `GlobalStyle` you can import

[This is the default theme](src/lib/defaultTheme.js)

## Usage

To install:

```shell
npm i basilikum
```

**-OR-**

```shell
yarn add basilikum
```

May be imported like this for example:

```js
import {Section} from 'basilikum';
```

## Motivation

The only real motivation was, that I had grown tired of writing all these
components from scratch time & again. Also it seemed fun.
